### Inspiration 

For many people one of their top ten fears - is the fear of death.  There is the need as human beings to cling to live and for some to practice precautionary measures to prolong their lives. Inspired by the vaccine debates and conspiracy theories that surrounds the safety of the different vaccine, we wanted to explore and analyze datasets as it relates to adverse effects recorded about COVID19 vaccine administered in the United States of America.



### What is it?

Right across the globe there are many with reservations of taking Covid-19 vaccine fearing there may be adverse effects. This project is an investigation to try to find the relatively most effective or in effective or safe or unsafe  administerd vaccinein comparison to the other vaccine noted in this project. Ineffective or unsafe is based on number of deaths without patients having any negative medical history or underline illnesses also included in the spectrum of unsafe is life threating symptoms and general symptoms without underline illnesses.


### How was it built? 

The team brainstormed for problems that we were interested in and passionated about. We originally narrowed it down to two problems of interest. We then explored the available datasets.We used Kaggle database to search for relevant datasets. The data was explored and observed if they may understand or questioned based on the problem we wanted to solve and also search for any possible insights the data may yield to answering our question We opted to work with the VAERS datasets  as we were faced with challenges while trying to upload another datasets (that was of a  sqllite format). VAERS datasets was in a .cvs format was far easier to use and upload in the google data studio.
We then derived a series of questions with the mission of answering our main goal in mind. 

We then started to clean the data- formatting fields to specific standard and consistent formats. The files were then uploaded to Google data studio where the data was analyzed by creating reports. The questions played a major role in our analysis as  we had to joined multiple datasets in ordered to access appropriate fields with the data that was suitable to answer our questions. We did simple reports before doing the ones that used compounded datas.

### Challenges
Challenges included learning new tools to complete the project. Also the loading the datasets was another challenge as group members experienced errors while trying to upload. Also there was an issue in finding consenual meeting hours as we had incomptiable work schedules. 

### What's next for our project
To create an appealing interface for our project that viewers would find easy to navigate and interact with.
