### Inspiration 

For many people one of their top ten fears is the fear of death.  As humans, for some, there is a need to cling to life and for others to practice precautionary measures to prolong their lives. Inspired by the vaccine debates and conspiracy theories that surrounds the safety of the different vaccines, we wanted to explore and analyze datasets as it relates to adverse effects recorded about COVID19 vaccine administered in the United States of America.



### What is it?

Right across the globe there are many with the fear of taking Covid-19 vaccines beacuse of the adverse effects that may occur. This project is an investigation into finding the relatively most effective/ineffective or safe/unsafe administered vaccine with the comparison to the other vaccines noted in this project. Ineffective or unsafe is based on the  number of deaths without patients having any negative medical history or underline illnesses. In addition to the spectrum of unsafe, is life threating symptoms and general symptoms without underline illnesses.


### How was it built? 

The team brainstormed for problems that we were interested in and passionated about. We originally narrowed it down to two problems of interest. We then explored the available datasets in the area of interest using Kaggle database. The data was observed, explored and possible questions were derived. Further assessment was done to the data to search for any possible insights that may yield to the answering of our question. The VAERS datasets was chosen as we were faced with challenges while trying to upload another datasets (that was of a sqllite format). The VAERS datasets was in a .cvs format that was far easier to use and upload in the Google Data Studio.
We then derived a more refined series of questions with the mission of answering with our main goal in mind. 

Afetr collecting the data, we started to clean the data - formatting fields to specific standards and consistent formats. The files were then uploaded to Google Data Studio where the data was analyzed by creating reports. The questions played a major role in our analysis as  we had to joined multiple datasets in ordered to access appropriate fields with the data that was suitable to answer our questions. We did simple reports before doing the ones that used compounded datas.

### Challenges
Challenges included learning new tools to complete the project. Also the loading the datasets was another challenge as group members experienced errors while trying to upload. Also there was an issue in finding consenual meeting hours as we had incomptiable work schedules. 

### What's next for our project
To create an appealing interface for our project that viewers would find easy to navigate and interact with.
