### Inspiration 

For many people one of their top ten fears - is the fear of death.  There is the need as human beings to cling to live and for some to practice to take precautions to prolong their lives. Inspired by the current vaccine debates and conspiracy theories that surrounds the safety of the different vaccines. We wanted to explore and   analyzed datasets as it relates to adverse effects recorded about COVID19 vaccine administered in the United States.

### How was it built? 

Team brainstoremed for problems we were interested  and passioned to  solve and originally recored two problems of interest. We then explored the available datasets. We opted to work with the VAERS datasets  as were faced with challenges while trying to  uploadi another dataset (that was of a  sqllite format). VAERS datasets was in a .cvs format was far easier to use and upload in the google data studio.
We then derived a series of questions with the mission of answering which vaccine is most unsafe  
We use Kaggle database to search for relevant datasets. The data was explored and observed if they may understand or questioned based on the problem we wanted to solve and also search for any possible insights the data may yield to answering our question
We then started to clean the data- formatting field names specific standard and consistent formats. The files were then uploaded google data studio where the data was analyzed by creating reports. The questions played a major role in our analysis as joined multiple datasets in ordered to use the appropriate fields with the data that was suitable to answer our questions.We simplified our questions at first before did questions that needed compounded datasets  

### Challenges
Challenges included learning new tools to complete the project. Also Loading the datasets was another challenge as group members experienced errors while trying to upload. Also there was an issue in finding consenual meeting hours as we had incomptiable work schedules.
